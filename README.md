# MonteCarlo-PP
Repository for to execute Probabilistic Power Flows based on MonteCarlo simulations and analysis for power systems with PandaPower

This repository serves as a tool for students and researchers to perform MonteCarlo simulations and analysis for power systems with PandaPower. 
The repository contains the following files:
- src: contains the source code for the MonteCarlo simulations and analysis
- data: contains the data for the power system
- docs: contains the documentation for the source code
- refs: contains the references for the source code



## Advantages of MonteCarlo
- Method to generate data samples for a study. The samples can follow an specific distribution of the analyst choosing.
- You can study the relationship of the such input samples and the behavior of the power system under study for operation and planning analysis.
